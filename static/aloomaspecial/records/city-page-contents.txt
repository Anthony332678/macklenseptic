Standard Porta-Potty Units<h2>
Our standard porta-potties are the go-to solution for job sites, outdoor gatherings, and temporary use. Each unit is ventilated, comes stocked with toilet paper, and features a non-flush holding tank system designed to meet ANSI and OSHA guidelines. Constructed from high-density polyethylene, these units are built to withstand high foot traffic and extreme outdoor conditions. We clean, disinfect, and restock all units before delivery, and our service schedule includes weekly maintenance and emergency pump-outs when needed. Macklen Portable Toilet Rental has delivered over 10,000 standard units since 2009 and maintains a fleet that exceeds current EPA and state compliance standards. When you need no-nonsense sanitation, our basic porta-potty is an efficient choice.

ADA-Compliant Units<h2>
Accessibility matters. Our ADA-compliant porta-potties feature ground-level entry, 360-degree turning radius space, reinforced grab bars, and a wider interior layout to accommodate users with mobility devices. These units meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and are ideal for public events, government projects, and any site welcoming diverse guests or workers. Heavy-duty, skid-resistant flooring reduces the risk of slips. Ventilation and solar-powered lighting can be added upon request. Macklen Portable Toilet Rental stays ahead of industry best practices through participation in the National Portable Sanitation Association’s training programs, ensuring that we’re not just offering ADA units—we’re ensuring proper site placement and access.

Flushable Porta-Potties in #State<h2>
Our flushable portable restrooms provide a more refined experience, ideal for weddings, corporate functions, and private parties. Equipped with foot-operated freshwater flush systems, enclosed waste tanks, and separate urinals, these units offer a higher level of hygiene and odor control. Every flushable unit comes with a built-in hand sanitizer dispenser and a coat hook or shelf for user convenience. These units are regularly deep-cleaned with hospital-grade disinfectants and are often paired with handwashing stations for a complete hygiene package. Macklen Portable Toilet Rental was recognized in 2022 by the #State  Outdoor Events Council for excellence in sanitary event planning services—proof of our attention to detail and performance.
$$
High-Capacity Units<h2>
For large-scale construction or multi-day events with heavy foot traffic, our high-capacity porta-potties are the practical choice. These units feature oversized holding tanks, dual ventilation ports, and heavy-duty construction designed to minimize service frequency. They’re favored by utility contractors and agricultural clients who require reliable function over extended periods. Optional add-ons include motion-sensor lighting, internal shelving, and frequent servicing schedules. Macklen Portable Toilet Rental partners with several local construction management associations to ensure these units meet evolving safety codes and crew comfort expectations. With fewer maintenance interruptions, your project can stay on schedule without compromising sanitation.
%%
Handwashing Stations<h2>
Proper hygiene begins with proper handwashing. We supply standalone handwashing stations with dual sinks, foot-pump faucets, soap dispensers, and paper towel holders. Each station holds up to 22 gallons of freshwater and 24 gallons of greywater, supporting hundreds of handwashes per event. These stations meet health department guidelines for food handling and construction safety. Perfect for farm stands, food festivals, or work zones where access to running water is limited. Macklen Portable Toilet Rental’s commitment to sanitation earned us an honorable mention in the 2021 Northwest Health & Safety Expo, reflecting our standards in public hygiene support.
